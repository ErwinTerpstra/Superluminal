# Superluminal
An experiment with baking lighting data in mesh vertices.

It contains two baking methods: converting from existing Unity lightmaps and caculating lighting using a rudementary raytracer.

Additionally, there is support for automatically tessellating meshes to match gradients in the lighting data.

Note that this is a toy project, not anywhere near production ready.
